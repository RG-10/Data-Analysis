## Data Preprocessing

In these projects, you will find examples of data preprocessing, where raw data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis. Techniques such as handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering are applied.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a critical step in data analysis. You will see how to identify and address issues with data quality, including handling duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies.

## Data Visualization

Data analysis often involves data visualization to gain insights. You'll find visualizations created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present data effectively.

Feel free to explore these notebooks and learn from the analyses and practices. Happy data exploring!
